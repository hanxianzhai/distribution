after using graphql, i found it too complicated

try to use APIJSON to find it too complicated

the currnet escape route is to use pythono + mongodb

the i felt that it was not difficult to write SQL on the front end, but it needed to be enhanced in terms of security + front-end adaptability

temporary version:

execute SQL directly, serialize JSON to the front end 

add online design data model and set data correlation and security, which overlaps with DataDesigner again
